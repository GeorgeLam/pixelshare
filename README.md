Pixelshare is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to crop, caption and upload photos, which can then be viewed, commented on, and liked by other users. Node and Express form the backend, and facilitate the uploading of photos to AWS S3, and metadata (photo URLs, captions, likes, and comments) to MongoDB. The design was created with Bootstrap, and is therefore fully responsive.
